**Hi,**

I'm Luis Felipe and I am a Software Engineer based in New York. Currently, I am a web developer at eGifter specializing in frontend technologies. I spend most of my day writing in TypeScript/JavaScript, VueJS, HTML, and SASS/CSS.

# How I Started

My interest in computing began in 2012 after looking for a cheap alternative to buying a computer for college. I had recently moved to New York, held two jobs, and didn't have much of a budget to go off of. A WD rep at a big box store suggested I build one if I really wanted to save money. And so after slowly gathering the required components over a series of months and reading every possible MaximumPC article, blog post, as well as watching an unhealthy amount of build videos on YouTube to the point I'd dream about the process, I finally built my PC without any friction.

Not having much left over to buy a Windows license I opted to go the Open Source route and went down rabbit hole. A lot of documentaries, 2600 articles, books, magazines, and forum posts later I was fully immersed in Linux, shell scripting, and the realization that I wanted to make this my job.

I majored in Computer Network Technology at community college. After dabbling with micro-controllers and electronics for a bit I thought I would go on to major in Electrical Engineering. Not long after transferring to a 4yr college I landed my first job in IT. I was an Application Specialist working on administering and maintaining SAP Business Intelligence products, generating reports in SQL Server, and setting up Windows Server instances.

I was also tasked with a very tedious job, searching for and merging duplicate parking infractions...by hand. After a two months of spending multiple days sifting through thousands of pages of records, and knowing this would be a recurring process I decided to make my life easier and apply a little automation by way of Python. And so after a few blog post tutorials on python, I crafted a very rough and inelegant script that would automate the duplicate matching process. I would go on to refining the script and taking on the additional role of developer working on .NET web projects with the development team. This one moment shifted my interests fully into programming and I haven't looked back since.

# Other Interests

I am a competitive powerlifter. I also help guide new lifters from training to handling them in competition.
